# Firstly

# Ask user which type of operation wish to use

'''operation = input("Which operation would like to use ? ")'''

# Ask user what number would like to choose first and then the second

'''numb1 = float(input("What is your first number would you like choose ? "))
numb2 = float(input("What is your second number would you like choose ? "))'''

# Testing...
# print(operation)
# print(numb1)
# print(numb2)
# Test done!

'''if(operation == "+"):
    total = numb1 + numb2
    print("The sum is: ", total)
elif(operation == "-"):
    total = numb1 - numb2
    print("The subtraction is: ", total)
elif(operation == "*"):
    total = numb1 * numb2
    print("The multiplication is: ", total)
elif(operation == "/"):
    total = numb1 / numb2
    print("The division is: ", total)
elif(operation == "**"):
    total = numb1 ** numb2
    print("The exponentiation is: ", total)
elif(operation == "%"):
    total = numb1 % numb2
    print("The module is: ", total)'''

# The first simple calculator was done

# Let's do an advanced calculator
